In this homework, you are going to implement deep neural networks using the Pytorch framework.
You are going to use the dataset that you have previously used for the third homework. The code to
load the datasets will be provided for you.

1) Try three different network architectures by changing the kernel sizes, number of filters, strides,
and number of hidden units on fully-connected layers, the number of convolutional and fullyconnected
layers, etc.
2) For each architecture, plot the training and test accuracies during training. The x-axis should
represent the number of epochs and the y-axis should represent the corresponding accuracy on
training and test sets. We want three separate plots for the three architectures each showing both
training and test values in different colors.
